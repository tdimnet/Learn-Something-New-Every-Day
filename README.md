# Learn Something New Every Day
This file is a short introduction of what this new challenge is.

---

## Introduction
After having started the 100 Days of Code Challenge (I am on my 48 day), I have decided to do something else. Trying to code my personal work every day is great and I do like it but with time I have decided that I also have to learn new things every day.

On Treehouse's blog, I have seen a post which has inspired me. The idea beyond the blog post was simple: learning every day something new during 15 minutes. Because it's a fact! When you work, or when we want to work, in the web industry we have to keep our skills sharp and there is always something new to learn (And honestly speaking, this is one of the part that I prefer).


## The concept
This new challenge is founded on the concept of the 100 days of code challenge. Every day, I will put on my log file what I have learned today (it could be a new CSS technique or how networks work). The idea is to keep track of what I am learning at the moment and to share my feelings.
Happy coding!

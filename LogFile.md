## Day 1: February 22. Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Today I have started a new course on Treehouse which speaks about HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol. After the quick introduction, I have started using Telnet, a command-line tool using to test HTTP Requests and Responses.

**Thoughts:** This is my very first day of this new challenge and I am a bit excited. I am looking forward to continue this journey :).

## Day 2: February 23. Thursday

**Today's Progress:** I have continue using Telnet in order to see both HTTP Request Format & HTTP Response Format (in HTML & XML). I have also played with Telnet by sending data with GET Request.

**Thoughts:** Well, this course is pretty interesting even though I already know some elements.

## Day 3: February 24. Friday

**Today's Progress:** Today I have learned how to send data with a POST Request by using Telnet. The thing is: the length of the POST Data sent should be the same as the Content-Length within the HTTP Request.

**Thoughts:** Well, using Telnet & plain text HTTP Requests & Responses are a bit tedious ^^.

## Day 4: February 26. Sunday

**Today's Progress:** After telnet, I saw that I can retrieve the exact same amount of information using my favorite web browser. It can sort the value in html or in plain text.

**Thoughts:** Ok, now I know that I can retrieve the information needed just with my web browser. I wonder what other crazy stuffs my web browser can do :D.

## Day 5: February 27. Monday

**Today's Progress:** Just saw how forms and anchors work with GET Requests within my web browser. Play with java.com & its search function.

**Thoughts:** Yep, I think I understand the main part & the main goal of this course. And maybe, I will have a look of forms in action.
